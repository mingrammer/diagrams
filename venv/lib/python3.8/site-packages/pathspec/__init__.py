"""
The *pathspec* package provides pattern matching for file paths. So far
this only includes Git's wildmatch pattern matching (the style used for
".gitignore" files).

The following classes are imported and made available from the root of
the `pathspec` package:

- :class:`pathspec.pathspec.PathSpec`

- :class:`pathspec.pattern.Pattern`

- :class:`pathspec.pattern.RegexPattern`

- :class:`pathspec.util.RecursionError`

The following functions are also imported:

- :func:`pathspec.util.iter_tree`
- :func:`pathspec.util.lookup_pattern`
- :func:`pathspec.util.match_files`
